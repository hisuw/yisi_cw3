  abstract = {We propose a multi-task ensemble framework that jointly learns multiple related problems. The ensemble model aims to leverage the learned representations of three deep learning models (i.e., CNN, LSTM and GRU) and a hand-crafted feature representation for the predictions. Through multi-task framework, we address four problems of emotion and sentiment analysis, i.e., “emotion classification & intensity ”, “ valence , arousal & dominance for emotion”, “ valence & arousal for sentiment”, and “ 3-class categorical & 5-class ordinal classification for sentiment”. The underlying problems cover two granularity (i.e., coarse-grained and fine-grained ) and a diverse range of domains (i.e., tweets , Facebook posts , news headlines , blogs , letters etc.). Experimental results suggest that the proposed multi-task framework outperforms the single-task frameworks in all experiments.},

  title={Real time Twitter sentiment analysis using natural language processing},
  abstract={Social media websites have emerged as one of the
  platforms to raise users’ opinions and influence the way any
  business is commercialized. Opinion of people matters a lot to
  analyze how the propagation of information impacts the lives in a
  large-scale network like Twitter. Data analysis of the tweets
  determine the polarity and inclination of vast population towards
  specific topic, item or entity. These days, the applications of such
  analysis can be easily observed during public elections, movie
  promotions, brand endorsements and many other fields. In this
  project, we will go through making a program that analyzes the
  nature of tweets on a particular topic. The primary aim is to
  provide a method for analyzing polarity score in noisy twitter
  streams. This paper reports on the design of a data analysis,
  extracting vast number of tweets.
   Results classify user's perception via tweets into
  positive and negative. In this project, we will go through making
  a program that analyzes the nature of tweets on a particular
  topic. The user will be able to input a keyword(hashtag) and get
  the nature on it based on the latest tweets that contain the input
  keyword. Each tweet extracted classified based on its sentiment
  whether it is a positive or negative. Data were collected on movie
  reviews which were on IMDB Website. Naïve Bayes machine
  learning algorithm was used. The result from this model was
  tested using various testing metrics. Moreover, our model
  demonstrates strong performance on mining texts extracted
  directly from Twitter.},

  title={Integrating multi-criteria decision-making with hybrid deep learning for sentiment analysis in recommender systems},
  author={Angamuthu, Swathi and Trojovsk{\`y}, Pavel},
  abstract={Expert assessments with pre-defined numerical or language terms can limit the scope of decision-making models. We propose that decision-making models can incorporate expert judgments expressed in natural language through sentiment analysis. To help make more informed choices, we present the Sentiment Analysis in Recommender Systems with Multi-person, Multi-criteria Decision Making (SAR-MCMD) method. This method compiles the opinions of several experts by analyzing their written reviews and, if applicable, their star ratings. The growth of online applications and the sheer amount of available information have made it difficult for users to decide which information or products to select from the Internet. Intelligent decision-support technologies, known as recommender systems, leverage users’ preferences to suggest what they might find interesting. Recommender systems are one of the many approaches to dealing with information overload issues. These systems have traditionally relied on single-grading algorithms to predict and communicate users’ opinions for observed items. To boost their predictive and recommendation abilities, multi-criteria recommender systems assign numerous ratings to various qualities of products. We created, manually annotated, and released the technique in a case study of restaurant selection using ‘TripAdvisor reviews’, ‘TMDB 5000 movies’, and an ‘Amazon dataset’. In various areas, cutting-edge deep learning approaches have led to breakthrough progress. Recently, researchers have begun to focus on applying these methods to recommendation systems, and different deep learning-based recommendation models have been suggested. Due to its proficiency with sparse data in large data systems and its ability to construct complex models that characterize user performance for the recommended procedure, deep learning is a formidable tool. In this article, we introduce a model for a multi-criteria recommender system that combines the best of both deep learning and multi-criteria decision-making. According to our findings, the suggested system may give customers very accurate suggestions with a sentiment analysis accuracy of 98%. Additionally, the metrics, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are where the system truly shines, much above what has been achieved in the past.},

  title={Intelligent chatbot interaction system capable for sentimental analysis using hybrid machine learning algorithms},
  abstract={Chatbots actively help the human user through digital conversation through NLP based on artificial intelligence (AI). It can be pre-trained to understand the user's queries and produce an immediate response in NLP. The user input of the chatbot is any format like voice, text, sentiments, etc. Many research works have been implemented. The issues of existing works are that during the digital conversation, it does not accurately identify the user's requirement, it may go irrelevant to the user's query, and also, primarily, it is voice-based and faces hitches in the analysis of the user's intention, unable to track the context in long-conversation. Therefore, for understanding the context, sentimental calculations are essential. This paper proposed to make the immediate response of users in the chatbot by using Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network with a Fuzzy Naïve Bayes classifier (BRNN-FNB). This paper aims to build chatbot models with AI-based sentimental analysis, which helps humans to perform accurate interactions. The working concept of chatbots is based on two forms of artificial intelligence domains: machine learning and natural language processing. It may be used in many applications like digital marketing, education, and online forums. The accuracy rate of the proposed work BRNN-FNB got 93% using the Seq-to-Seq technique. And also, the accuracy rate of the proposed work BRNN-FNB without using Seq-to-Seq got 92%.},

  abstract={As a crucial component of Natural Language Processing, sentiment analysis autonomously identifies and categorizes the positive and negative emotions reflected in social media text data. Here, the proposed work examines the viability of using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a technique for machine learning to decipher online comments. Analysis of public opinion is crucial in the information age. Due to its nonlinear separability and efficacy with high-dimensional data, SVM is well-suited for this task. The bag-of-words technique is utilized for data acquisition, cleaning, and feature extraction. The SVM model is trained using cross-validation and hyperparameter adjustment, resulting in a 97% accuracy rate. Compared to other algorithms, the proposed SVM technique is preferable to the current method. The proposed work sheds light on how to assess the attitudes of social media users, whose findings may have significant implications for industries, including advertising, politics, and brand public opinion.},

  abstract={Sentimental Analytics is the phenomenon used to show the feelings of different people, emotions, opinions. It is also referred as the opinion meaning, which identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text The Mechanism gives whether the result is positive, negative, or neutral. It gives finer results, to keep track of users, and tells whether the tweet is uplifted or down lifted by the user's content. Machine learning can be analyzed by using various analysis algorithms to provide a precise value. Machine learning algorithms play a major role in various domains, and one of them includes data analysis. In this work, machine learning techniques are used to predict the Twitter analysis. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm are used for implementation.
