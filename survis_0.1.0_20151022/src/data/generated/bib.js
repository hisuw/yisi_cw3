        "abstract": "As a crucial component of Natural Language Processing, sentiment analysis autonomously identifies and categorizes the positive and negative emotions reflected in social media text data. Here, the proposed work examines the viability of using Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a technique for machine learning to decipher online comments. Analysis of public opinion is crucial in the information age. Due to its nonlinear separability and efficacy with high-dimensional data, SVM is well-suited for this task. The bag-of-words technique is utilized for data acquisition, cleaning, and feature extraction. The SVM model is trained using cross-validation and hyperparameter adjustment, resulting in a 97% accuracy rate. Compared to other algorithms, the proposed SVM technique is preferable to the current method. The proposed work sheds light on how to assess the attitudes of social media users, whose findings may have significant implications for industries, including advertising, politics, and brand public opinion.",

        "abstract": "We propose a multi-task ensemble framework that jointly learns multiple related problems. The ensemble model aims to leverage the learned representations of three deep learning models (i.e., CNN, LSTM and GRU) and a hand-crafted feature representation for the predictions. Through multi-task framework, we address four problems of emotion and sentiment analysis, i.e., \u201cemotion classification & intensity \u201d, \u201c valence , arousal & dominance for emotion\u201d, \u201c valence & arousal for sentiment\u201d, and \u201c 3-class categorical & 5-class ordinal classification for sentiment\u201d. The underlying problems cover two granularity (i.e., coarse-grained and fine-grained ) and a diverse range of domains (i.e., tweets , Facebook posts , news headlines , blogs , letters etc.). Experimental results suggest that the proposed multi-task framework outperforms the single-task frameworks in all experiments.",

        "abstract": "Expert assessments with pre-defined numerical or language terms can limit the scope of decision-making models. We propose that decision-making models can incorporate expert judgments expressed in natural language through sentiment analysis. To help make more informed choices, we present the Sentiment Analysis in Recommender Systems with Multi-person, Multi-criteria Decision Making (SAR-MCMD) method. This method compiles the opinions of several experts by analyzing their written reviews and, if applicable, their star ratings. The growth of online applications and the sheer amount of available information have made it difficult for users to decide which information or products to select from the Internet. Intelligent decision-support technologies, known as recommender systems, leverage users\u2019 preferences to suggest what they might find interesting. Recommender systems are one of the many approaches to dealing with information overload issues. These systems have traditionally relied on single-grading algorithms to predict and communicate users\u2019 opinions for observed items. To boost their predictive and recommendation abilities, multi-criteria recommender systems assign numerous ratings to various qualities of products. We created, manually annotated, and released the technique in a case study of restaurant selection using \u2018TripAdvisor reviews\u2019, \u2018TMDB 5000 movies\u2019, and an \u2018Amazon dataset\u2019. In various areas, cutting-edge deep learning approaches have led to breakthrough progress. Recently, researchers have begun to focus on applying these methods to recommendation systems, and different deep learning-based recommendation models have been suggested. Due to its proficiency with sparse data in large data systems and its ability to construct complex models that characterize user performance for the recommended procedure, deep learning is a formidable tool. In this article, we introduce a model for a multi-criteria recommender system that combines the best of both deep learning and multi-criteria decision-making. According to our findings, the suggested system may give customers very accurate suggestions with a sentiment analysis accuracy of 98%. Additionally, the metrics, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are where the system truly shines, much above what has been achieved in the past.",

Opinion of people matters a lot to analyze how the propagation of information impacts the lives in a large-scale network like Twitter. Data analysis of the tweets determine the polarity and inclination of vast population towards specific topic, item or entity. These days, the applications of such analysis can be easily observed during public elections, movie promotions, brand endorsements and many other fields. In this project, we will go through making a program that analyzes the nature of tweets on a particular topic. The primary aim is to provide a method for analyzing polarity score in noisy twitter streams. This paper reports on the design of a data analysis, extracting vast number of tweets. Results classify user's perception via tweets into positive and negative. In this project, we will go through making a program that analyzes the nature of tweets on a particular topic. The user will be able to input a keyword(hashtag) and get the nature on it based on the latest tweets that contain the input keyword. Each tweet extracted classified based on its sentiment whether it is a positive or negative. Data were collected on movie reviews which were on IMDB Website. Na\u00efve Bayes machine learning algorithm was used. The result from this model was tested using various testing metrics. Moreover, our model demonstrates strong performance on mining texts extracted directly from Twitter.",

This research paper examines the use of machine learning algorithms to predict sentiments using a dataset of self-reported information. The models - Naive Bayes classifier and Recurrent Neural Network are investigated for predicting the sentiments of the data and compared in terms of their performance.

        "abstract": "Chatbots actively help the human user through digital conversation through NLP based on artificial intelligence (AI). It can be pre-trained to understand the user's queries and produce an immediate response in NLP. The user input of the chatbot is any format like voice, text, sentiments, etc. Many research works have been implemented. The issues of existing works are that during the digital conversation, it does not accurately identify the user's requirement, it may go irrelevant to the user's query, and also, primarily, it is voice-based and faces hitches in the analysis of the user's intention, unable to track the context in long-conversation. Therefore, for understanding the context, sentimental calculations are essential. This paper proposed to make the immediate response of users in the chatbot by using Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network with a Fuzzy Na\u00efve Bayes classifier (BRNN-FNB). This paper aims to build chatbot models with AI-based sentimental analysis, which helps humans to perform accurate interactions. The working concept of chatbots is based on two forms of artificial intelligence domains: machine learning and natural language processing. It may be used in many applications like digital marketing, education, and online forums. The accuracy rate of the proposed work BRNN-FNB got 93% using the Seq-to-Seq technique. And also, the accuracy rate of the proposed work BRNN-FNB without using Seq-to-Seq got 92%.",

To do this, we perform analyses on Twitter datasets made publicly available by NLTK Corpora and create an efficient feature by using a feature extraction technique. We train and test various machine learning classifiers such as MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression, SGD classifier, SVC, LinearSVC, and NuSVC. Experimental results demonstrate that BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression, and SGD classifier reached accuracy as high as 75%.",
